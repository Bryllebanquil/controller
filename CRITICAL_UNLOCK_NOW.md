# 🚨 CRITICAL: YOUR SYSTEM IS LOCKED - UNLOCK NOW! 🚨

## ⚠️ IMMEDIATE PROBLEM

Your system is currently **LOCKED** by the agent:

### What's Blocked:
- ❌ **Task Manager** - Cannot open (Ctrl+Shift+Esc doesn't work)
- ❌ **Registry Editor** - Cannot open (regedit blocked)
- ❌ **Command Prompt** - Cannot open (cmd blocked)
- ❌ **Admin Password Required** - Every admin app asks for password

### Why This Happened:

The agent modified these registry keys:

```
HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System
  - DisableTaskMgr = 1 (disabled)
  - DisableRegistryTools = 1 (disabled)

HKCU\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\System
  - DisableCMD = 1 (disabled)

HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System
  - ConsentPromptBehaviorAdmin = 1 (requires password)
```

---

## ✅ IMMEDIATE FIX - DO THIS NOW!

### Method 1: Use EMERGENCY_UNLOCK.bat (FASTEST)

```batch
1. Right-click EMERGENCY_UNLOCK.bat
2. Click "Run as administrator"
3. Enter admin password ONE MORE TIME
4. Press any key when prompted
5. Choose YES to restart
6. After restart, everything is unlocked!
```

**This will:**
- ✅ Re-enable Task Manager
- ✅ Re-enable Registry Editor
- ✅ Re-enable Command Prompt
- ✅ Fix UAC (no more password prompts)

---

### Method 2: Run restore.bat (COMPLETE CLEANUP)

```batch
1. Right-click restore.bat
2. Click "Run as administrator"
3. Enter password
4. Wait for completion
5. Restart computer
```

**This will:**
- ✅ Unlock everything (same as Method 1)
- ✅ Remove ALL agent traces
- ✅ Clean registry
- ✅ Delete all files

---

### Method 3: Manual Fix (If scripts don't work)

If you can't run the scripts:

#### Step 1: Get to Command Prompt as Admin

Press **Windows + X** → Click **"Windows PowerShell (Admin)"** or **"Terminal (Admin)"**

#### Step 2: Run these commands:

```batch
REM Re-enable Task Manager
reg delete "HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System" /v "DisableTaskMgr" /f
reg add "HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System" /v "DisableTaskMgr" /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /f

REM Re-enable Registry Editor
reg delete "HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System" /v "DisableRegistryTools" /f
reg add "HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System" /v "DisableRegistryTools" /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /f

REM Re-enable Command Prompt
reg delete "HKCU\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\System" /v "DisableCMD" /f
reg add "HKCU\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\System" /v "DisableCMD" /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /f

REM Fix UAC (stop password prompts)
reg add "HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System" /v "ConsentPromptBehaviorAdmin" /t REG_DWORD /d 5 /f
```

#### Step 3: Restart Computer

```
shutdown /r /t 0
```

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT WARNINGS

### Before Unlocking:

1. **Stop the agent first:**
   ```
   Right-click Taskbar → Task Manager
   (If it opens) → Find pythonw.exe or svchost32.exe → End Task
   ```

2. **If Task Manager won't open:**
   - Use EMERGENCY_UNLOCK.bat immediately
   - This is why you can't open it!

3. **Password prompts are caused by:**
   - `ConsentPromptBehaviorAdmin = 1`
   - The fix changes it to `5` (consent without password)

---

## 🎯 Root Cause

The agent set these values in `client.py` line 2396-2410:

```python
# Set Task Manager registry value to 0 (keep enabled)
subprocess.run([
    'reg', 'add', 'HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Policies\\System',
    '/v', 'DisableTaskMgr', '/t', 'REG_DWORD', '/d', '1', '/f'  # ← Set to 1 = DISABLED!
], creationflags=subprocess.CREATE_NO_WINDOW)

# Same for Registry Editor and CMD
# All set to 1 = DISABLED
```

And UAC settings (line 3540):

```python
# Set ConsentPromptBehaviorAdmin to 0 (no prompts for administrators)
winreg.SetValueEx(key, "ConsentPromptBehaviorAdmin", 1, winreg.REG_DWORD, 1)
# ↑ Comment says 0, but code sets it to 1 = PASSWORD REQUIRED!
```

---

## ✅ After Running EMERGENCY_UNLOCK.bat

### What Changes:

```
BEFORE:
❌ DisableTaskMgr = 1
❌ DisableRegistryTools = 1
❌ DisableCMD = 1
❌ ConsentPromptBehaviorAdmin = 1 (password required)

AFTER:
✅ DisableTaskMgr = 0
✅ DisableRegistryTools = 0
✅ DisableCMD = 0
✅ ConsentPromptBehaviorAdmin = 5 (consent only)
```

### Result:
- ✅ Task Manager opens
- ✅ Registry Editor opens
- ✅ Command Prompt opens
- ✅ Admin apps don't ask for password
- ✅ Full system control restored
