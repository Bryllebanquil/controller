# üö® CRITICAL: YOU MUST INSTALL PACKAGES!

## Your Logs Still Show:

```
[WARNING] numpy not available, some features may not work
[WARNING] opencv-python not available, video processing may not work
```

## This Means:

**YOU HAVE NOT INSTALLED THE REQUIRED PACKAGES YET!**

## Fix the NameError AND Install Packages:

### Step 1: Copy the updated client.py
(I just fixed the NameError)

### Step 2: Install the packages
```bash
pip install numpy opencv-python mss
```

### Step 3: Restart agent
```bash
python client.py
```

## Why BOTH Fixes Are Needed:

1. **NameError Fix**: Code organization issue - FIXED NOW
2. **Missing Packages**: YOU need to install them - NOT DONE YET

## After Installing, You Should See:

**NO MORE THESE WARNINGS:**
```
‚ùå [WARNING] numpy not available
‚ùå [WARNING] opencv-python not available
```

**INSTEAD YOU'LL SEE:**
```
‚úÖ [INFO] Started modern non-blocking video stream at 15 FPS
```

## Quick Command:

```bash
pip install numpy opencv-python mss && python client.py
```

**RUN THIS NOW!**
