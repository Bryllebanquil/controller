# Check if NotificationCenter is Loaded

## 🔍 Quick Browser Test

Open your browser console and run this:

```javascript
// Check if window event listener is registered
window.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent('socket_notification', { 
  detail: {
    id: 'test_' + Date.now(),
    type: 'success',
    title: 'Manual Test',
    message: 'Testing notification system',
    category: 'system',
    timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
    read: false
  }
}));
```

### What Should Happen:

**If the new code is loaded:**
```
🔔 NotificationCenter: Received notification via window event: {...}
🔔 NotificationCenter: Adding notification to list: {...}
🔔 NotificationCenter: Calling showToast...
🎉 Showing toast notification: Manual Test
✅ Success toast displayed: Manual Test
```
**AND** a green popup should appear!

**If old code is still cached:**
- Nothing happens, or
- Only see "Received notification via window event"
- No popup appears

---

## ✅ If It Works

Great! The code is loaded. Now test with the Python script:
```powershell
python test_notifications.py
# Choose option 8 (Info notification)
```

---

## ❌ If It Doesn't Work

The cached JavaScript is still loaded. Try these in order:

### 1. Empty Cache and Hard Reload (Chrome/Edge)
1. Press F12 (open DevTools)
2. **Right-click** the refresh button (next to address bar)
3. Select **"Empty Cache and Hard Reload"**

### 2. Clear Site Data (Chrome/Edge)
1. Press F12
2. Go to **Application** tab
3. Left sidebar → **Storage**
4. Click **"Clear site data"** button
5. Refresh page

### 3. Clear Browsing Data
1. Press **Ctrl + Shift + Delete**
2. Select:
   - ✅ Cached images and files
   - ✅ Cookies and other site data
3. Time range: **Last hour**
4. Click **Clear data**
5. Close and reopen browser
6. Go to site again

### 4. Try Incognito/Private Window
1. Press **Ctrl + Shift + N** (Chrome) or **Ctrl + Shift + P** (Firefox)
2. Go to: https://agent-controller-backend.onrender.com
3. Login
4. Run the browser test above

### 5. Check Render Deployment
Go to: https://dashboard.render.com
- Find: `agent-controller-backend`
- Check "Events" tab
- Latest event should be: **"Deploy live"** with a recent timestamp

If it says "Deploying..." wait 2-3 more minutes.

## 🎯 Definitive Test

If after all the above the popup still doesn't work, run this in console:

```javascript
// Force show a toast directly
import('https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/sonner@1.3.1/dist/index.mjs').then(({ toast }) => {
  toast.success('Direct Toast Test', {
    description: 'If you see this, Sonner is working'
  });
});
```

**If you see a popup**: Sonner works, but NotificationCenter isn't wired up
**If you don't see a popup**: Sonner isn't loaded properly

---

## 📞 Report Back

After trying these steps, let me know:
1. Did the manual test work? (window.dispatchEvent)
2. Did the direct Sonner test work? (import toast)
3. What does Render deployment status show?
4. Are you using Chrome, Firefox, or Edge?

This will help me diagnose the exact issue!
