# Test Notifications with Real Agent Connections

## ‚úÖ This Works RIGHT NOW (No deployment needed!)

Your Render instance already has the notification system working for **automatic events**. You can test it immediately:

### Step 1: Open Your UI
1. Go to: https://agent-controller-backend.onrender.com
2. Login with your admin password
3. Look for the **Bell icon (üîî)** in the top-right corner

### Step 2: Connect a Test Agent

Run your client to trigger a **real notification**:

```bash
# Make sure your client.py is configured to connect to Render
python client.py
```

**Configuration needed in client.py:**
```python
# Update this line in client.py:
CONTROLLER_URL = "https://agent-controller-backend.onrender.com"
```

### Step 3: Watch the Notifications!

You should see:
- üü¢ **Green "Agent Connected"** notification when client connects
- üü° **Yellow "Agent Disconnected"** notification when you stop the client (Ctrl+C)

### Step 4: Test Bulk Actions

1. Connect 2-3 agents
2. In the UI, select multiple agents
3. Perform a bulk action (e.g., "Get System Info" on all)
4. Watch for **system notifications** about the bulk action results

## üîÑ After Render Deployment

Once you manually deploy on Render (or wait for auto-deploy), the test endpoint will work:

```bash
python test_notifications.py
# Choose option 2 for full test suite
```

Until then, use real agent connections to test! üöÄ
