VERIFICATION CHECKLIST:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

✅ CONNECTION_STATE global variable (Lines 779-787)
✅ stop_all_operations() function (Lines 5938-5969)
✅ connection_health_monitor() function (Lines 5971-6035)
✅ Enhanced connect() handler with state update (Lines 8706-8731)
✅ Enhanced disconnect() handler with cleanup (Lines 8733-8752)
✅ Health monitor thread started (Lines 13207-13211)
✅ Connection state updated on success (Lines 13241-13244)
✅ Connection state updated on failure (Lines 13350-13357)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

WHAT YOU FIXED:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

PROBLEM:
❌ Streams kept running after disconnect
❌ "Socket.IO not connected; deferring frames" spam
❌ Agent zombie state (appears online, can't execute)
❌ Commands fail after reconnection

SOLUTION:
✅ Health monitor checks every 1 second
✅ Stops all operations on disconnect
✅ Forces clean reconnect if dead
✅ Commands work immediately after reconnect

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

COMPILE & TEST:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Run: FIX_AND_COMPILE.bat

Then test:
1. Start agent
2. Start camera/screen streams
3. Let it lag and disconnect
4. Watch for cleanup logs
5. Wait for reconnect
6. Execute command
7. ✅ Should work immediately!

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

EXPECTED BEHAVIOR:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

[HEALTH_MONITOR] ✅ Connection ACTIVE
... normal operation ...
[HEALTH_MONITOR] ❌ Connection LOST - initiating cleanup...
[CLEANUP] All operations stopped
[DISCONNECT] Cleanup complete - will auto-reconnect
... reconnecting ...
[HEALTH_MONITOR] ✅ Connection ACTIVE
[CONNECT] Connected to controller
✅ Commands work!

NO MORE "deferring frames" spam!

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

ALL DONE! Compile and test! 🚀
