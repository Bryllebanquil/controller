  COMPLETE FIX FOR WSL COMMAND EXECUTION ERROR
================================================================

PROBLEM: Commands execute in WSL instead of Windows
================================================================

When you run commands like "ls", "dir", "systeminfo", etc., you get:

  "Windows Subsystem for Linux has no installed distributions."

This happens because:
  1. Your system has WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) enabled
  2. PowerShell is being routed to WSL
  3. WSL has no Linux distributions installed
  4. All commands fail

================================================================
SOLUTION: Use CMD.exe Instead of PowerShell
================================================================

The fix is simple: Change client.py to use CMD.exe with full path
instead of powershell.exe

================================================================
METHOD 1: AUTOMATED FIX (EASIEST)
================================================================

1. Copy FIX_WSL_ISSUE.py to your directory:
   C:\Users\Brylle\render deploy\controller\

2. Open PowerShell in that directory:
   cd "C:\Users\Brylle\render deploy\controller"

3. Run the fix script:
   python FIX_WSL_ISSUE.py

4. It will automatically:
   - Backup your client.py
   - Replace powershell.exe with cmd.exe
   - Add RLock warning suppression
   - Save the fixed file

5. Test it:
   python client.py

6. Try commands in the controller UI:
   dir
   systeminfo
   ipconfig

Should work now!

================================================================
METHOD 2: MANUAL FIX (IF SCRIPT DOESN'T WORK)
================================================================

1. Open client.py in Notepad or VS Code

2. Press Ctrl+F and search for:
   powershell.exe

3. You should find a line like this (around line 6297-6298):
   
   ["powershell.exe", "-NoProfile", "-Command", command]

4. Replace that ENTIRE line with:

   ["C:\\Windows\\System32\\cmd.exe", "/c", command]

5. Also find this line (around line 6302):

   creationflags=subprocess.CREATE_NO_WINDOW

6. Replace it with:

   creationflags=subprocess.CREATE_NO_WINDOW if hasattr(subprocess, 'CREATE_NO_WINDOW') else 0,
   encoding='utf-8',
   errors='replace'

7. Save the file (Ctrl+S)

8. Test it:
   python client.py

================================================================
METHOD 3: DISABLE WSL (SYSTEM-WIDE FIX)
================================================================

If you want to fix WSL routing for all applications:

1. Open PowerShell as Administrator

2. Disable WSL:
   dism.exe /online /disable-feature /featurename:Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux /norestart

3. Restart your computer

4. WSL will be completely disabled

Note: This affects ALL applications, not just client.py

================================================================
VERIFICATION
================================================================

After applying the fix, you should see:

BEFORE:
  $ dir
  Windows Subsystem for Linux has no installed distributions.
  [ERROR]

AFTER:
  $ dir
  Volume in drive C has no label.
  Directory of C:\Users\Brylle\...
  [Shows file list]
  [SUCCESS]

Test these commands to verify:
  - dir         (should list files)
  - systeminfo  (should show system info)
  - ipconfig    (should show network info)
  - tasklist    (should list processes)
  - echo test   (should print "test")

================================================================
TECHNICAL EXPLANATION
================================================================

The Problem:
  client.py line 6297 uses:
    subprocess.run(["powershell.exe", "-NoProfile", "-Command", command])
  
  On your system, "powershell.exe" is aliased/routed to WSL
  WSL has no distributions installed
  All commands fail

The Solution:
  Use full path to Windows CMD:
    subprocess.run(["C:\\Windows\\System32\\cmd.exe", "/c", command])
  
  This bypasses WSL and uses native Windows CMD
  All commands work correctly

Why cmd.exe instead of PowerShell?
  - CMD.exe is always available
  - CMD.exe has a fixed location
  - CMD.exe doesn't route to WSL
  - CMD.exe supports all standard Windows commands

================================================================
WHAT CHANGED IN THE FIX
================================================================

Line ~6297 - Changed from:
  ["powershell.exe", "-NoProfile", "-Command", command]

To:
  ["C:\\Windows\\System32\\cmd.exe", "/c", command]

Key differences:
  powershell.exe        → C:\\Windows\\System32\\cmd.exe
  -NoProfile -Command   → /c
  (WSL routing)         → (Native Windows)

================================================================
TROUBLESHOOTING
================================================================

Q: Still getting WSL errors after fix?
A: Make sure you:
   1. Saved the file after editing
   2. Edited the RIGHT file (C:\Users\Brylle\render deploy\controller\client.py)
   3. Restarted client.py after fixing

Q: Can't find "powershell.exe" in client.py?
A: Search for "execute_command" function instead
   The line should be inside that function

Q: Script says "No changes needed"?
A: Your file might already be fixed, OR the pattern is different
   Try the manual fix method

Q: Commands still don't work?
A: Check if you have proper permissions
   Try running client.py as Administrator

================================================================
SUMMARY
================================================================

Issue:    Commands execute in WSL (no distributions)
Cause:    PowerShell routed to WSL
Fix:      Use cmd.exe with full path
Result:   Commands work in native Windows
Time:     2 minutes to fix
Difficulty: Easy
