### **Sliver C2 Framework**
**Version:** v1.5.43  
**Developer:** BishopFox  
**Repository:** https://github.com/BishopFox/sliver  
**License:** GPLv3

We acknowledge [Sliver](https://github.com/BishopFox/sliver) by BishopFox as a source of inspiration for our command and control architecture. Sliver is an excellent open-source adversary emulation framework that has set high standards for C2 frameworks.

**What We Learned from Sliver:**
- Multi-session agent management
- Organized command structures
- Security best practices
- Comprehensive feature sets
- Professional documentation standards

**How We Differ:**
- **Web-based UI** vs Sliver's CLI interface
- **Real-time visual streaming** capabilities
- **Modern responsive design** for all devices
- **Python + React** stack vs Go
- **Enhanced Windows capabilities** (32+ UAC bypasses, 20+ privilege escalation methods)
