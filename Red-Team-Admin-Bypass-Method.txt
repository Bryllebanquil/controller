Cold Boot Attack on Network Hardware: Performing a cold boot attack on a router to extract encryption keys from RAM for traffic decryption.

Crucial Red Team Considerations for Network MITM:
Segmentation is Your Enemy: Flat networks make MITM easy. Segmented networks (VLANs, firewalls) severely limit your options. You must first pivot into the target segment.

Encryption is Your Biggest Hurdle: Without the ability to defeat encryption (via rogue CA, downgrade attacks, or exploiting implementation flaws), your interception will be limited to metadata.

Impact & Detection: ARP spoofing and other active techniques are noisy. Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) like Suricata or Zeek will likely spot them. Understand your target's monitoring capabilities.

Post-Compromise is Key: Often, the most effective "MITM" is achieved post-exploitation by installing a root certificate and a proxy on the victim machine itself, rather than attacking the network layer.

Rules of Engagement: Always ensure these techniques are within the agreed scope of your exercise. Intercepting and modifying production traffic without explicit permission is illegal and unethical.

This list provides a deep arsenal for your network-focused red teaming. Mastery comes from understanding not just the "how" but the "when" and "why" of each technique.

Implementation Considerations:
Operational Security:
Test techniques in isolated environments first

Understand your target's specific security controls

Use multiple techniques in combination

Have fallback methods ready

Clean up thoroughly after operations

Detection Avoidance:
Monitor for security product updates

Use custom tooling when possible

Avoid well-documented IOCs

Implement proper opsec for each technique

Understand normal network patterns to blend in

Tool Development:
Compile custom versions of tools

Obfuscate code signatures

Use unique compilation parameters

Implement anti-analysis techniques

Test against multiple security products

These techniques represent the current state of advanced adversary tradecraft. Success requires careful planning, testing, and adaptation to the specific environment you're targeting.
