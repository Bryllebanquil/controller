# Agent Controller UI v2.1 - Output Display Fixes

## Issue Identified
The terminal output in the Agent Controller UI was displaying incorrectly with text wrapping issues and poor formatting. The output text was not preserving whitespace and line breaks properly, making it difficult to read command results.

## Root Cause
The output display containers were missing critical CSS properties for handling terminal/console-style text:
- No whitespace preservation (`whitespace-pre-wrap`)
- No word-breaking for long lines (`break-words`)

## Files Modified

### 1. CommandPanel.tsx
**Location:** `/workspace/agent-controller ui v2.1/src/components/CommandPanel.tsx`

#### Fix 1: Main Output Display (Line 224)
**Before:**
```tsx
<div className="bg-black text-green-400 p-4 rounded font-mono text-sm min-h-[200px] max-h-[400px] overflow-auto">
```

**After:**
```tsx
<div className="bg-black text-green-400 p-4 rounded font-mono text-sm min-h-[200px] max-h-[400px] overflow-auto whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">
```

#### Fix 2: Command History Output (Line 264)
**Before:**
```tsx
<div className="text-xs text-muted-foreground bg-muted p-2 rounded font-mono">
```

**After:**
```tsx
<div className="text-xs text-muted-foreground bg-muted p-2 rounded font-mono whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">
```

### 2. ErrorBoundary.tsx
**Location:** `/workspace/agent-controller ui v2.1/src/components/ErrorBoundary.tsx`

#### Fix 1: Error Message Display (Line 62)
**Before:**
```tsx
<p className="font-mono text-sm">{this.state.error.message}</p>
```

**After:**
```tsx
<p className="font-mono text-sm whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">{this.state.error.message}</p>
```

#### Fix 2: Error Stack Trace (Line 90)
**Before:**
```tsx
<pre className="mt-2 text-xs bg-muted p-3 rounded-md overflow-auto max-h-64">
```

**After:**
```tsx
<pre className="mt-2 text-xs bg-muted p-3 rounded-md overflow-auto max-h-64 whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">
```

## CSS Classes Added

### `whitespace-pre-wrap`
- Preserves whitespace and line breaks from the terminal output
- Allows text to wrap when it reaches the container boundary
- Maintains the formatted structure of command results

### `break-words`
- Breaks long words or strings that would overflow the container
- Prevents horizontal scrolling from extremely long unbroken strings
- Ensures content stays within the visible area

## Testing & Verification

### Build Status
✅ **Build Successful**
- All TypeScript compilation passed
- No errors or type issues
- Build output: 564.59 kB (gzip: 159.23 kB)

### Components Scanned
✅ CommandPanel - Fixed (2 locations)
✅ ErrorBoundary - Fixed (2 locations)
✅ ProcessManager - Reviewed (numeric data only, no fix needed)
✅ SystemMonitor - Reviewed (no issues found)
✅ Other components - Reviewed (no terminal output displays)

## Impact

### Before
- Terminal output text wrapped incorrectly
- Line breaks were not preserved
- Long strings overflowed or wrapped awkwardly
- Difficult to read command results
- Poor user experience when viewing file listings, system info, etc.

### After
- Terminal output displays exactly as returned from the agent
- Line breaks and whitespace are preserved
- Long lines wrap properly within the container
- Clean, readable terminal-style output
- Professional appearance matching real terminal behavior

## Additional Notes

1. **Build Tools Permissions**: Fixed execute permissions for `esbuild` and `vite` binaries in node_modules during the build process.

2. **No Breaking Changes**: All changes are purely cosmetic (CSS additions) and do not affect functionality or data handling.

3. **Backward Compatible**: The fixes maintain all existing behavior while improving display quality.

4. **Performance**: No performance impact - CSS-only changes with negligible overhead.

## Deployment

The fixed UI has been successfully built and is ready for deployment. The built assets are located in:
```
/workspace/agent-controller ui v2.1/build/
```

## Summary

Successfully identified and fixed terminal output display issues across the Agent Controller UI v2.1 by adding proper CSS text handling properties (`whitespace-pre-wrap` and `break-words`) to all terminal/console output containers. The UI now correctly displays command results, error messages, and debugging information with proper formatting and readability.
